# Activity Tracker

# Overview

This project is a distributed app developed for the course Distributed Systems at AUEB. It provides users with a comprehensive tool for analyzing their activity tracking data. 

The system consists of a mobile frontend application for the UI and a [backend](https://github.com/kwstaseL/Activity-Tracker-Backend) system for data analysis.
